# Classroom-Link
Software Engineering Project

This was a project done for our Second Year Software Engineering Project. We aim to develop a prototype web application in Java solving a real world issue. This project consisted of four memebrs including myself, Mohammed Haaris Moghal, Shahbaz Farnood, Alexander Kovalkovas and Eisa Abdullah Masud Anwar.

To run the prototype please click the "ClassroomLink" java executable. The default password for the Admin Page is "password". 

There has been a growing disconnect between teachers and guardians. Many are
not as informed about their child's performance at school as they would like to be.
Parent’s evening is one event that tries to alleviate this issue but as it only occurs
once or twice a year, it doesn’t solve the problem. Some guardians are not able to
attend these evenings or make appointments with teachers as they simply do not
have the time due to work constraints.

This prototype website is intended to be used by secondary school students up to GCSE and
their respective guardians and teachers. This is an important time for students as the
results of these exams can have a significant impact on a students life. This is not
targeted towards older students they are more mature and should not require their
parents to have access to their schoolwork.

This website connects teachers, guardians and students making sure guardians are
aware of their child's progress. This website will allow teachers to upload the results
of pupils work which the student and their guardian(s) will be able to see, update
current grades and give general feedback on the student’s performance. Guardians
can access their child’s data by logging onto the website. The website will also
feature a built-in private messaging system where guardians and teachers can
communicate quickly and efficiently at any time, so no longer will the guardian need
to phone in or email the teacher and wait for a response. This website would also
allow students, guardians and teachers to make private comments on their work that
the relevant students, guardians and teachers will be able to read.
This website will be online 24/7 so at any time any user can check information, they
are not limited to do this during certain hours.
